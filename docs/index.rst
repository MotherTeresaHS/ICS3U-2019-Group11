In this project we will be making a webapp for storing all the chocolate treats that you eat. To set this up, follow this tutorial first by Mr. Coxall, `here <https://aws-serverless-web-application.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

The guide assumes that you have prior coding experience, hopefully in Python. It is designed to use just introductory concepts. No Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are used so that students in particular that have completed their first course in coding and know just variables, if statements, loops and functions will be able to follow along.

**Parts**

You will need the following items:

.. container:: twocol

  .. container:: leftside

    .. image:: ./images/4200-01.jpg
      :width: 320 px
      :height: 240 px
      :alt: PyBadge
      :align: left

  .. container:: rightside

    `Adafruit PyBadge for MakeCode Arcade, CircuitPython or Arduino <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200>`_
    
    PRODUCT ID: 4200
